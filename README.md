1. Download the provided code
2. Import it to your Assets, create an empty gameobject and attach the script. Script probably works for recent versions, until Unity 2019 or so.
3. Create a prefab with the object you would like to generate, and attach it. Feel free to adjust the settings.
4. HIGHLY Recommended not to increase the depth unless you have a very high end computer, at all. Keep it at 1, to keep your frames.
